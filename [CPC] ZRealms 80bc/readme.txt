## THE PLOT
##################

The biggest and strongest realms of ZRealms are in an endless war.
By one side Amstradia, the realms of 64 kbytes, plenty of people 
smart and happy, but a little limited. 
By the other Spectria, a wide 128 kbytes realm, full of color and
very nice people.
One day the life of these two kingdoms were truncated by war. 
No one remembers how it started but the people of each side are 
enemies since every one can remember.

But there are hope! You are a brave, quick and strong messenger
who has started a dialog between each realm. The negotiations are
going good and peace seems nearest than ever.
But there are people trying to stop you. People who want the war 
because their hearts are black and hopeless.

Your mission is to bring each message from one kingdom to the other
until the war comes to end. Avoid warriors and other enemies wich 
will try to stop you.

Good Luck, you are the last hope!
