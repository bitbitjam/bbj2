Black Star
==========

Black Star was put together for BitBitJam 2015!

The theme was "confronted kingdoms" and my interpretations was "two factions
fighting each other" and I went for the easiest good vs evil, light vs
darkness.

The solar system of the Kingdom of Heavens has enjoyed peace for thousands of
years until an unknown force appeared in the sky of one of their worlds: a
wormhole to a dying system.

The last hope of the Kingdom is the battleship class Black Star, that will try
to repel the horde at all costs.


Controls
--------

The game supports keyboad, Kempston and Sinclair joysticks.

Default keys are (can be redefined):

 - left: o
 - right: p
 - fire: space

Also backspace can be used to end the game and go back to the menu.

Press any key if you want to skip the intro!


Target platform
---------------

This game targets the *ZX Spectrum 48k*, that means around 41 KB for the game
and no dedicated sound chip (no AY-3-8912 sound, only 1-bit beeper!).

Nevertheless I think it is a fun platform to develop for, and the games will
work in later models too (128, +2 and +2A, possibly +3).

The main reason of the jam is to encourage participants to release code that
can be read by other to learn and help keeping the old machines alive; so I did
my best to comment the code, although the time constraints were quite tough in
this edition (48 hours).

Enjoy!
