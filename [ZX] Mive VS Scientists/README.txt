HOW IT IS MADE

In a dark laboratory, valerous mice fight for their freedom against crazy scientists.

HOW WE MADE IT

	With the help of the framework "CHURRERA", we write a simple script and draw the assets, later we make the map with a utility named tiled, and at least we make the music with the help of "BEEPOLA" and "BEEPFX".
