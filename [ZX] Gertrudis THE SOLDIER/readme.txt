How was it done:

We begun our litle experience with any idea about doing videogames, we just 
used to love play videogames and we admired the people who made then. But today
on Sunday the 26th of July. We have already created our FIRST videogame and we 
"know" how we did it. How "desing it", how "paint it" and, how "program it".
It was a such nice experience and we enjoyed a lot. We have to repeat with more
time for create a really big game, but we're proud of what we have done. REALLY 
PROUD OF IT #meme.
